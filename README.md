## Description

_A web application for a tap room._
Since our Angular application is not styles I'm going to create a new one simplifying this website:
https://trailbendtaproom.com

## Specifications

* The applications should have a list of all available kegs.
* The user should be able to add a new keg with 124 pints left.
* The user should be able decrease by one the number of pints left.
* The user should be able to edit the keg.

## Questions during the development process
  How to change the data since it's static now?

## Difference between Angular and React
  When we started Angular I expected the components should be very specific and narrow. But apparently they are not. Here in React they are very specific and their functions are very narrow.
